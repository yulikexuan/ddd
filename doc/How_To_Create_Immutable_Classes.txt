1.  Make class final, so that no other classes can extend it

2.  Make all fields final, so that theyâ€™re initialized only once inside the
    constructor and never modified afterward

3.  Don't expose setter methods

4.  When returning mutable fields from immutable object, should always return
    a clone instance of them and not the real instance of the field

5.  If the immutable class A holds a instance of mutable class B:

    - Inside the constructor of class A, make sure to use a clone copy of the
      passed argument of class B and never set the mutable field of class A to
      the real instance of class B passed through constructor;

      - This is to prevent the clients who pass the instance object of class B
        from modifying it afterwards

    - Make sure to always return a clone copy of the field and never return the
      real object instance
